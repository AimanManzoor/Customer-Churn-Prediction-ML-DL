# Customer-Churn-Prediction-ML-DL
End-to-end customer churn prediction using classical machine learning and deep learning models. Includes EDA, feature engineering, SMOTE balancing, model tuning (LogReg, RF, XGBoost), and deep learning with MLP and TabNet â€” all focused on actionable business insights.
A complete churn prediction pipeline using structured customer data â€” from exploratory analysis to model deployment. This project combines classical ML and deep learning (MLP, TabNet) to build interpretable and high-performing retention models that support real-world business decisions.



## ðŸš€ Model Comparison Summary

This project evaluates several models for customer churn prediction. Below is a performance comparison:

| Model                  | Accuracy | Recall | Precision | ROC AUC |
|------------------------|----------|--------|-----------|---------|
| Logistic Regression    | 79%      | 0.12   | 0.32      | 0.65    |
| Logistic + SMOTE       | 82%      | 0.68   | 0.38      | 0.75    |
| Random Forest          | 82%      | 0.43   | 0.44      | 0.74    |
| XGBoost                | 83%      | 0.41   | 0.48      | 0.74    |
| MLP (Deep Learning)    | 82%      | 0.39   | 0.47      | 0.77    |
| TabNet (Deep Learning) | 82%      | 0.40   | 0.49      | 0.77    |

> These results support strategic churn reduction, enabling data-driven decisions aligned with business goals.
